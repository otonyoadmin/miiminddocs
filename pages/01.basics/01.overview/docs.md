### Process Orientations Enables Process Management
### Not suitable for human development systems using persona, Meme bound or language name bound self conceptions

Full Spectrum Servant Leadership enabling modalities with infinitely inclusive dynamic processing and adaptation management.
Superior Cognitive Processing framework integrates seamlessly using Doubtless Self Conception and the insights of modern pragmatism solutions to enable active self correcting error processing.

Mi-iMind provides a method for self validating, processing and managing continuously emergent knowledge in a human Me-Mind, living one time forward lifetime.
iStates are used as designators that can use complex numbers and or names of attention bound awareness events in time within the one time forward lived experience lifetime of the individual Me-Mind.
It is essential to see that the differences between this approach and the western 5 stages of psychology developed is not concerned with the history and past it is only concerned with the present. In as much as a current autobiograbhy will reveal great insight into the patterns in the current Me-Mind the story of the present as it relates to the past o

The transition from ego bound personal I self conception provides direct challenges from within the individual Me-Mind for all who would choose to process emergent knowledge using these more inclusive frameworks and networked solutions.

What may be a surprise for some mathematics and analytic philosophy enthusiasts is the use of concepts like compassion as part of a knowledge system that essentially treats the subjects and objects of the mind as vacuous delusions to be dissolved. Inner perceptions of sunken values privately influence the emergent knowledge flow. We are all familiar with the 'I' that stays in a couple for the sake of the kids yet the two individuals are not doing the same thing for the same reason. Senior corporate management very often obfuscate lie and deny the actualities for the sake of the institution or the perceived functions of the institution in the case of Religious institutional corruption of emergent knowledge flow.   


Process management of complex systems has advanced in leaps and bounds over the past 30 years in particular and coupled with our understanding of how information can be scientifically traced as energy presents new possibilities for emergent knowledge flow management using process controls.
Mi-iMind provides a framework for managing the information gathered in lived experiences while identifying how knowledge is being polluted by the will bound to to debunked sunken values.

The messy and often hidden challenge that has continued to pollute emergent knowledge is the human self conception carried in persona bound self conceptions. Self conceptions rooted in narrative identities create sunken value commitments in personal narratives. This is very obvious is our public and private lives where we can obsess about the names that other call us including terms like nig*er which are so offensive and genuinely painful for some to encounter that they cannot even be written without understandable censure in social media.


Arguments concerning how to interpret emergent knowledge such as climate change or celebrity culture have been mired in notions of the human as the root centre of meaning

The solutions enable new synergies using a profound paradigm shift for internalizing EmptiSelf conception based upon the Doubtless Self conception that emerges from the intellectual understandiing of the  Buddhist heart sutra and current process management solutions which make it possible to map iterative ever better development locally using lived experience in relationship with iStats of awareness.
The synergies are made available in a fundamentality new format of designation using number rooted names in which enable infinite inner inclusion of Me-Mind iStates.
It can be helpful to think of iStates as both atomic and molecular in nature if we want we can think of them as chemical and biological or as complex recurring patterned entities that we name Personas.
The eschewing of the persona bound self conception presents real tangible problems for a Me-Mind that wants to follow the knowledge flow as it emerges in each of us in our private minds' each living one time forward lifetime. The broken hearted teenager in the Me-Mind of my past crest fallen at the end of the first true romance in the world overcomes the isolation in survival mode. The first time in the Me-Mind alone in anguish and anger when the language being heard is more like cackle than useable wisdom as the self within reveals its nature again as never only that iState of yesterday there is always another peace in Me-Mind..

Let's face it: Writing content for the Web is tiresome. WYSIWYG editors help alleviate this task, but they generally result in horrible code, or worse yet, ugly web pages.

**Markdown** is a better way to write **HTML**, without all the complexities and ugliness that usually accompanies it.

Some of the key benefits are:

1. Markdown is simple to learn, with minimal extra characters so it's also quicker to write content.
2. Less chance of errors when writing in markdown.
3. Produces valid XHTML output.
4. Keeps the content and the visual display separate, so you cannot mess up the look of your site.
5. Write in any text editor or Markdown application you like.
6. Markdown is a joy to use!

John Gruber, the author of Markdown, puts it like this:

> The overriding design goal for Markdown’s formatting syntax is to make it as readable as possible. The idea is that a Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it’s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions. While Markdown’s syntax has been influenced by several existing text-to-HTML filters, the single biggest source of inspiration for Markdown’s syntax is the format of plain text email.
> -- <cite>John Gruber</cite>


Grav ships with built-in support for [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and [Markdown Extra](https://michelf.ca/projects/php-markdown/extra/). You must enable **Markdown Extra** in your `system.yaml` configuration file

Without further delay, let us go over the main elements of Markdown and what the resulting HTML looks like:

>>> <i class="fa fa-bookmark"></i> Bookmark this page for easy future reference!

## Headings

Headings from `h1` through `h6` are constructed with a `#` for each level:

```markdown
# h1 Heading
## h2 Heading
### h3 Heading
#### h4 Heading
##### h5 Heading
###### h6 Heading
```

Renders to:

# h1 Heading
## h2 Heading
### h3 Heading
#### h4 Heading
##### h5 Heading
###### h6 Heading

HTML:

```html
<h1>h1 Heading</h1>
<h2>h2 Heading</h2>
<h3>h3 Heading</h3>
<h4>h4 Heading</h4>
<h5>h5 Heading</h5>
<h6>h6 Heading</h6>
```

<br>
<br>
<br>

## Comments

Comments should be HTML compatible

```html
<!--
This is a comment
-->
```
Comment below should **NOT** be seen:

<!--
This is a comment
-->

<br>
<br>
<br>

## Horizontal Rules

The HTML `<hr>` element is for creating a "thematic break" between paragraph-level elements. In markdown, you can create a `<hr>` with any of the following:

* `___`: three consecutive underscores
* `---`: three consecutive dashes
* `***`: three consecutive asterisks

renders to:

___

---

***


<br>
<br>
<br>


## Body Copy

Body copy written as normal, plain text will be wrapped with `<p></p>` tags in the rendered HTML.

So this body copy:

```markdown
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, graecis denique ei vel, at duo primis mandamus. Et legere ocurreret pri, animal tacimates complectitur ad cum. Cu eum inermis inimicus efficiendi. Labore officiis his ex, soluta officiis concludaturque ei qui, vide sensibus vim ad.
```
renders to this HTML:

```html
<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, graecis denique ei vel, at duo primis mandamus. Et legere ocurreret pri, animal tacimates complectitur ad cum. Cu eum inermis inimicus efficiendi. Labore officiis his ex, soluta officiis concludaturque ei qui, vide sensibus vim ad.</p>
```


<br>
<br>
<br>


## Emphasis

### Bold
For emphasizing a snippet of text with a heavier font-weight.

The following snippet of text is **rendered as bold text**.

```markdown
**rendered as bold text**
```
renders to:

**rendered as bold text**

and this HTML

```html
<strong>rendered as bold text</strong>
```

### Italics
For emphasizing a snippet of text with italics.

The following snippet of text is _rendered as italicized text_.

```markdown
_rendered as italicized text_
```

renders to:

_rendered as italicized text_

and this HTML:

```html
<em>rendered as italicized text</em>
```


### strikethrough
In GFM (GitHub flavored Markdown) you can do strikethroughs.

```markdown
~~Strike through this text.~~
```
Which renders to:

~~Strike through this text.~~

HTML:

```html
<del>Strike through this text.</del>
```

<br>
<br>
<br>


## Blockquotes
For quoting blocks of content from another source within your document.

Add `>` before any text you want to quote.

```markdown
> **Fusion Drive** combines a hard drive with a flash storage (solid-state drive) and presents it as a single logical volume with the space of both drives combined.
```

Renders to:

> **Fusion Drive** combines a hard drive with a flash storage (solid-state drive) and presents it as a single logical volume with the space of both drives combined.

and this HTML:

```html
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Fusion Drive</strong> combines a hard drive with a flash storage (solid-state drive) and presents it as a single logical volume with the space of both drives combined.</p>
</blockquote>
```

Blockquotes can also be nested:

```markdown
> Donec massa lacus, ultricies a ullamcorper in, fermentum sed augue.
Nunc augue augue, aliquam non hendrerit ac, commodo vel nisi.
>> Sed adipiscing elit vitae augue consectetur a gravida nunc vehicula. Donec auctor
odio non est accumsan facilisis. Aliquam id turpis in dolor tincidunt mollis ac eu diam.
```

Renders to:

> Donec massa lacus, ultricies a ullamcorper in, fermentum sed augue.
Nunc augue augue, aliquam non hendrerit ac, commodo vel nisi.
>> Sed adipiscing elit vitae augue consectetur a gravida nunc vehicula. Donec auctor
odio non est accumsan facilisis. Aliquam id turpis in dolor tincidunt mollis ac eu diam.


<br>
<br>
<br>

## Notices

We have four notice styles and they extend the standard markdown syntax for block quotes.  Basically levels of 3 block quote or greater produce notices in 4 colors:

### Yellow

```markdown
>>> Sed adipiscing elit vitae augue consectetur a gravida nunc vehicula. Donec auctor
odio non est accumsan facilisis. Aliquam id turpis in dolor tincidunt mollis ac eu diam.
```

Renders to:

>>> Sed adipiscing elit vitae augue consectetur a gravida nunc vehicula. Donec auctor
odio non est accumsan facilisis. Aliquam id turpis in dolor tincidunt mollis ac eu diam.

### Red

```markdown
>>>> Sed adipiscing elit vitae augue consectetur a gravida nunc vehicula. Donec auctor
odio non est accumsan facilisis. Aliquam id turpis in dolor tincidunt mollis ac eu diam.
```

Renders to:

>>>> Sed adipiscing elit vitae augue consectetur a gravida nunc vehicula. Donec auctor
odio non est accumsan facilisis. Aliquam id turpis in dolor tincidunt mollis ac eu diam.

### Blue

```markdown
>>>>> Sed adipiscing elit vitae augue consectetur a gravida nunc vehicula. Donec auctor
odio non est accumsan facilisis. Aliquam id turpis in dolor tincidunt mollis ac eu diam.
```

Renders to:

>>>>> Sed adipiscing elit vitae augue consectetur a gravida nunc vehicula. Donec auctor
odio non est accumsan facilisis. Aliquam id turpis in dolor tincidunt mollis ac eu diam.

### Green

```markdown
>>>>>> Sed adipiscing elit vitae augue consectetur a gravida nunc vehicula. Donec auctor
odio non est accumsan facilisis. Aliquam id turpis in dolor tincidunt mollis ac eu diam.
```

Renders to:

>>>>>> Sed adipiscing elit vitae augue consectetur a gravida nunc vehicula. Donec auctor
odio non est accumsan facilisis. Aliquam id turpis in dolor tincidunt mollis ac eu diam.

<br>
<br>
<br>


## Lists

### Unordered
A list of items in which the order of the items does not explicitly matter.

You may use any of the following symbols to denote bullets for each list item:

```markdown
* valid bullet
- valid bullet
+ valid bullet
```

For example

```markdown
+ Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
+ Consectetur adipiscing elit
+ Integer molestie lorem at massa
+ Facilisis in pretium nisl aliquet
+ Nulla volutpat aliquam velit
  - Phasellus iaculis neque
  - Purus sodales ultricies
  - Vestibulum laoreet porttitor sem
  - Ac tristique libero volutpat at
+ Faucibus porta lacus fringilla vel
+ Aenean sit amet erat nunc
+ Eget porttitor lorem
```
Renders to:

+ Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
+ Consectetur adipiscing elit
+ Integer molestie lorem at massa
+ Facilisis in pretium nisl aliquet
+ Nulla volutpat aliquam velit
  - Phasellus iaculis neque
  - Purus sodales ultricies
  - Vestibulum laoreet porttitor sem
  - Ac tristique libero volutpat at
+ Faucibus porta lacus fringilla vel
+ Aenean sit amet erat nunc
+ Eget porttitor lorem

And this HTML

```html
<ul>
  <li>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet</li>
  <li>Consectetur adipiscing elit</li>
  <li>Integer molestie lorem at massa</li>
  <li>Facilisis in pretium nisl aliquet</li>
  <li>Nulla volutpat aliquam velit
    <ul>
      <li>Phasellus iaculis neque</li>
      <li>Purus sodales ultricies</li>
      <li>Vestibulum laoreet porttitor sem</li>
      <li>Ac tristique libero volutpat at</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Faucibus porta lacus fringilla vel</li>
  <li>Aenean sit amet erat nunc</li>
  <li>Eget porttitor lorem</li>
</ul>
```

### Ordered

A list of items in which the order of items does explicitly matter.

```markdown
1. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
2. Consectetur adipiscing elit
3. Integer molestie lorem at massa
4. Facilisis in pretium nisl aliquet
5. Nulla volutpat aliquam velit
6. Faucibus porta lacus fringilla vel
7. Aenean sit amet erat nunc
8. Eget porttitor lorem
```
Renders to:

1. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
2. Consectetur adipiscing elit
3. Integer molestie lorem at massa
4. Facilisis in pretium nisl aliquet
5. Nulla volutpat aliquam velit
6. Faucibus porta lacus fringilla vel
7. Aenean sit amet erat nunc
8. Eget porttitor lorem

And this HTML:

```html
<ol>
  <li>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet</li>
  <li>Consectetur adipiscing elit</li>
  <li>Integer molestie lorem at massa</li>
  <li>Facilisis in pretium nisl aliquet</li>
  <li>Nulla volutpat aliquam velit</li>
  <li>Faucibus porta lacus fringilla vel</li>
  <li>Aenean sit amet erat nunc</li>
  <li>Eget porttitor lorem</li>
</ol>
```

**TIP**: If you just use `1.` for each number, Markdown will automatically number each item. For example:

```markdown
1. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
1. Consectetur adipiscing elit
1. Integer molestie lorem at massa
1. Facilisis in pretium nisl aliquet
1. Nulla volutpat aliquam velit
1. Faucibus porta lacus fringilla vel
1. Aenean sit amet erat nunc
1. Eget porttitor lorem
```

Renders to:

1. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
2. Consectetur adipiscing elit
3. Integer molestie lorem at massa
4. Facilisis in pretium nisl aliquet
5. Nulla volutpat aliquam velit
6. Faucibus porta lacus fringilla vel
7. Aenean sit amet erat nunc
8. Eget porttitor lorem


<br>
<br>
<br>


## Code

### Inline code
Wrap inline snippets of code with `` ` ``.

```markdown
In this example, `<section></section>` should be wrapped as **code**.
```

Renders to:

In this example, `<section></section>` should be wrapped with **code**.

HTML:

```html
<p>In this example, <code>&lt;section&gt;&lt;/section&gt;</code> should be wrapped with <strong>code</strong>.</p>
```

### Indented code

Or indent several lines of code by at least four spaces, as in:

<pre>
  // Some comments
  line 1 of code
  line 2 of code
  line 3 of code
</pre>

Renders to:

    // Some comments
    line 1 of code
    line 2 of code
    line 3 of code

HTML:

```html
<pre>
  <code>
    // Some comments
    line 1 of code
    line 2 of code
    line 3 of code
  </code>
</pre>
```


### Block code "fences"

Use "fences"  ```` ``` ```` to block in multiple lines of code.

<pre>
``` markup
Sample text here...
```
</pre>


```
Sample text here...
```

HTML:

```html
<pre>
  <code>Sample text here...</code>
</pre>
```

### Syntax highlighting

GFM, or "GitHub Flavored Markdown" also supports syntax highlighting. To activate it, simply add the file extension of the language you want to use directly after the first code "fence", ` ```js `, and syntax highlighting will automatically be applied in the rendered HTML. For example, to apply syntax highlighting to JavaScript code:

<pre>
```js
grunt.initConfig({
  assemble: {
    options: {
      assets: 'docs/assets',
      data: 'src/data/*.{json,yml}',
      helpers: 'src/custom-helpers.js',
      partials: ['src/partials/**/*.{hbs,md}']
    },
    pages: {
      options: {
        layout: 'default.hbs'
      },
      files: {
        './': ['src/templates/pages/index.hbs']
      }
    }
  }
};
```
</pre>

Renders to:

```js
grunt.initConfig({
  assemble: {
    options: {
      assets: 'docs/assets',
      data: 'src/data/*.{json,yml}',
      helpers: 'src/custom-helpers.js',
      partials: ['src/partials/**/*.{hbs,md}']
    },
    pages: {
      options: {
        layout: 'default.hbs'
      },
      files: {
        './': ['src/templates/pages/index.hbs']
      }
    }
  }
};
```

<br>
<br>
<br>



## Tables
Tables are created by adding pipes as dividers between each cell, and by adding a line of dashes (also separated by bars) beneath the header. Note that the pipes do not need to be vertically aligned.


```markdown
| Option | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| data   | path to data files to supply the data that will be passed into templates. |
| engine | engine to be used for processing templates. Handlebars is the default. |
| ext    | extension to be used for dest files. |
```

Renders to:

| Option | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| data   | path to data files to supply the data that will be passed into templates. |
| engine | engine to be used for processing templates. Handlebars is the default. |
| ext    | extension to be used for dest files. |

And this HTML:

```html
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Option</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>data</td>
    <td>path to data files to supply the data that will be passed into templates.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>engine</td>
    <td>engine to be used for processing templates. Handlebars is the default.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>ext</td>
    <td>extension to be used for dest files.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
```

### Right aligned text

Adding a colon on the right side of the dashes below any heading will right align text for that column.

```markdown
| Option | Description |
| ------:| -----------:|
| data   | path to data files to supply the data that will be passed into templates. |
| engine | engine to be used for processing templates. Handlebars is the default. |
| ext    | extension to be used for dest files. |
```

| Option | Description |
| ------:| -----------:|
| data   | path to data files to supply the data that will be passed into templates. |
| engine | engine to be used for processing templates. Handlebars is the default. |
| ext    | extension to be used for dest files. |

## Links

### Basic link

```markdown
[Assemble](http://assemble.io)
```

Renders to (hover over the link, there is no tooltip):

[Assemble](http://assemble.io)

HTML:

```html
<a href="http://assemble.io">Assemble</a>
```


### Add a title

```markdown
[Upstage](https://github.com/upstage/ "Visit Upstage!")
```

Renders to (hover over the link, there should be a tooltip):

[Upstage](https://github.com/upstage/ "Visit Upstage!")

HTML:

```html
<a href="https://github.com/upstage/" title="Visit Upstage!">Upstage</a>
```

### Named Anchors

Named anchors enable you to jump to the specified anchor point on the same page. For example, each of these chapters:

```markdown
# Table of Contents
  * [Chapter 1](#chapter-1)
  * [Chapter 2](#chapter-2)
  * [Chapter 3](#chapter-3)
```
will jump to these sections:

```markdown
## Chapter 1 <a id="chapter-1"></a>
Content for chapter one.

## Chapter 2 <a id="chapter-2"></a>
Content for chapter one.

## Chapter 3 <a id="chapter-3"></a>
Content for chapter one.
```
**NOTE** that specific placement of the anchor tag seems to be arbitrary. They are placed inline here since it seems to be unobtrusive, and it works.


<br>
<br>
<br>


## Images
Images have a similar syntax to links but include a preceding exclamation point.

```markdown
![Minion](http://octodex.github.com/images/minion.png)
```
![Minion](http://octodex.github.com/images/minion.png)

or
```markdown
![Alt text](http://octodex.github.com/images/stormtroopocat.jpg "The Stormtroopocat")
```
![Alt text](http://octodex.github.com/images/stormtroopocat.jpg "The Stormtroopocat")

Like links, Images also have a footnote style syntax

```markdown
![Alt text][id]
```
![Alt text][id]

With a reference later in the document defining the URL location:

[id]: http://octodex.github.com/images/dojocat.jpg  "The Dojocat"


    [id]: http://octodex.github.com/images/dojocat.jpg  "The Dojocat"
